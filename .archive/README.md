# Archive Folder

This folder contains reference documentation, development artifacts, and deprecated files that are kept for historical reference but are not part of the core production deployment.

## Contents

### Documentation & Summaries

### Deprecated Workflows

## Note

These files are preserved for:
- Historical reference
- Development insights
- Testing capabilities
- Migration assistance

The main production deployment now uses the All-In-One (AIO) workflow (`workflow-aio.yml`) which consolidates all functionality into a single, easy-to-deploy file.
